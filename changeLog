A makefile for CONF=CygWin was added
The Perl script 'makedependencies.pl' is used to create 'dependencies' for the targets to be recreated
Obviously, CygWin packages 'gfrortran', 'make' and 'perl' are prerequisites
libMATH77.a was installed in /usr/local/lib; from http://www.netlib.org/math/math77.tgz
gunzip -c math77.tgz | tar xvf -; gfortran *.f; ar cvf libMATH77.a *.o

The following changes were made
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
m_utils.f90
--------------
ifdef GNU added to avoid USE IFPORT

LREC is intent(IN)
{This solved this runtime error
	Error in subroutine: sysopen

	Error: Could not open file for reading

	Relevant parameters:
  	Io-status = 5002
  	File type = text
  	Filename  = /OPS/Meteo/m095104c.001
  	Filetype  = meteo file

	Procedure 'sysopen' was called by:
  	ops_readdata
  	ops_statfil
  	ops_readmeteo
  	ops_main
}

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
ops_main.f90
--------------
ifdef GNU added to avoid USE IFPORT
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
inum.f90 added
--------------
because IFPORT was not available
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
m_ops_building.f90
--------------
Apparently, gfortran requires all strings in an arrat to be equal length in a "data" assignment statement
Hence buildingParamNames was padded with blanks, into CbuildingParamNames, and 2 subroutines
where augmented with trimming, as per:

character(len=200) :: buildingParamNames(mBparms)
integer :: j
    do j = 1, mBparms
       buildingParamNames(j) = trim( CbuildingParamNames(j) )
    enddo
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
m_ops_emis.f90
--------------
call ops_openlog replaced by ierr = ops_openlog because a variable cannot have the same name as a subroutine
both ops_openlog and ierr declared LOGICAL
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
m_getkey.f90
--------------
LOGICAL first ! not integer
INTEGER inum ! added
